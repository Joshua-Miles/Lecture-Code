# Waterfall VS Agile

### Waterfall Approach

1. Dump a bunch of information (user stories) in a document
   - User Story: As a user I should be able to move a character
   - Product Requirement: A Character class that listens for keyboard events and move an image in response
2. Build out the models (decide what data needs to be stored and how you'll store it in tables)
3. Planning the rest (views, routes, controller methods, aggregate model methods)
4. Write the code, from the models to the views
5. Test
6. Operations



### SCRUM Approach

- Deliver working software as often as possible 

- Roles
  - Product Owner
    - How does the product ultimately meet the needs of the customer
  - Scrum Master
    - Servant Leader within the Dev Team
    - Not really a manager
      - Not hierarchical 
      - Doesn't dictate
      - Rather they support
  - Development Team Member
    - No one is locked in to a specific role
    - Cross functional
    - Cross-training
- Events
  - Sprint Planning
    - Time Locked (For example, if it lasts one week, it cannot be extended or made shorter)
    - Goals of the sprint: Write a list of user stories
    - Assign team members responsible for those stories
  - Sprint 
    - Daily SCRUM
  - Sprint Review
    - What is the state of the product?
  - Sprint Retrospective
    - What is the state of the team?
