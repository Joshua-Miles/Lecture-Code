# Rails Form Helpers

### Learning Goals

- Use `form_with`,`form.text_input`, and `form.submit` to create a form for a resource
- Use `form.collection_select` and `form.collection_check_boxes` to create inputs for associations
- Use Authenticity Tokens to make forms more secure



### Activation

- Yesterday we saw how Rails could abstract away some of the verbosity of custom routes
- It also has functions to help us write better forms
  - Allowing us to write less HTML
  - And even making our app more secure



### Learning Goal 1: Use `form_with`,`form.text_input`, and `form.submit` to create a form for a resource

##### Discussion Points: 

* `form_with` creates a form
  * With an authenticity token!
* Can be used 2 ways
  * `url: `
  * `model: ` 
    * Uses path helpers from `resources`!
* Takes in a code block which is given a `form` object
* Form object has methods for creating inputs and labels
* We'll come back to make a `select` box later

* **Review what the name of the `input` is used to do**



### Learning Goal 2: Use `collection_select`  to create an input for an association

##### Discussion Points: 

* Now let's build the select box, looking at some documentation



### Learning Goal 3: Authenticity Tokens to make forms more secure

##### Discussion Points: 

- Demonstrate Cross Site Request Forgery
- InvalidAuthenticityToken Error
- What the Authenticity Token is used for



##### Vocabulary
- `form_with`
  - A function which creates a `<form>` tag
- `form.text_field`
  - A function which creates a `<input type="text">` tag
- `form.submit`
  - A function which creates a `<input type="submit">` tag
- `collection_select`
  - A rails helper method which creates a select box (useful for one-to-many relationships)
- Strong Params
  - Methods of the `params` hash which allow us to filter input from a controller
- Authenticity Token
  - A random string generated by Rails, which can be used to ensure that a form request came from our app
