# Automated Testing

### Learning Goals

- Install a testing suite named RSpec in an ActiveRecord Project
- Write a unit test with RSpec
- Describe various kinds of software tests


### Activation 

##### Time: 0:00

Finish save method

  ActiveRecord::Base.logger = nil
  ActiveRecord::Base.establish_connection(

  )
else
  ActiveRecord::Base.establish_connection(
    adapter: 'sqlite3',
