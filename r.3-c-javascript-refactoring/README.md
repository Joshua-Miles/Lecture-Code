# Penguingotchi

### User Stories

* A user should be able to:
    * see their penguingotchi when the page loads
    * see their penguingotchi's hunger, and happy meters
    * click on a "Feed Them" button to reduce their hunger
    * click on a "Play with Them" button to increase their happiness
    * all changes should be saved on the server
    * see that the penguingotchi get's a little hungrier and a little less happy each time the page loads


* What exactly are you getting back from a fetch
    * How can you tell?
    * Usually we'll get back either 
        * a single object
        * or an array of objects
        * `console.log` your result so you can tell
    * `for-in` loop versus `forEach`
        * Every datastructure has keys and values
        * In an array the keys are numbers (not that important to us)
            * We can use `forEach` to iterate over the values of an array
        * In an object the keys should be (but aren't always) relevant/important
            * We can use `for-in` iterate over the keys of the object
            * and we can always get the value using the key
    * Do we always get something back from a fetch?
   
        
* Seeing things update on the page without having to refresh
