# JavaScript Tooling

##### Time Estimate: 1:30



## Learning Goals

- Define NPM, Babel, and JSX as tools for developing with JavaScript
- Use WebPack's Import Syntax to distribute code in multiple files
- Use `create-react-app` to setup Babel, WebPack, and JSX for you



### Activation

##### What were some of the biggest pain points did we experience this week?

- File splitting (dependancy management)
- Imperitive syntax 
  - `document.createElement`
  - `constructor` fields

Common thread: **Lack of structure**
